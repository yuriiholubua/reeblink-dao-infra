# Roadmap: DAO Series Activation Protocol

This document outlines the development phases of DAO Series Activation Protocol beyond the MVP. The roadmap is divided into three stages: MVP scope, near-term priorities, and full protocol expansion.

---

## ✅ Phase 1 — MVP (covered by grant)

**Goal:** Demonstrate reproducible Master DAO architecture and Genesis Layer interaction

- GenesisLayer contract (registration of Master DAOs)
- MasterDAO template (with jurisdiction and agreement hash)
- Name reservation mechanism
- Operating agreement auto-generation
- IPFS/Arweave document publishing
- CLI Deployment Tool
- README + architecture in two languages

---

## 🚧 Phase 2 — Series Extension + Token Logic

**Goal:** Enable DAO Series creation, NFT linkage, and basic token mapping

- DAO Series contract
- Series Factory (deploy from Master DAO)
- Asset-NFT linking model
- Ownership verification mechanism (oracle/validator logic)
- DAO Series agreement template (legal)
- Minimal frontend interface
- `series_activation.md` documentation

---

## 🌐 Phase 3 — Full Real Asset Network Protocol

**Goal:** Deploy full decentralized infrastructure with token economics

- Real asset network token (REBL or similar)
- Token issuance linked to verified assets
- Usage/rent-based revenue protocols
- DAO-based revenue distribution
- Multi-asset class support (real estate, licenses, IP, etc.)
- Integration with government registries (via APIs or mirrored storage)
- Global Master DAO validator network (Delaware-based)

## 🔄 Modularity

Each phase is released as an open-source component, with modular upgrades and public governance potential.
