# DAO Series Activation Protocol  
**Genesis + Master DAO MVP**

## 📌 Introduction

DAO Series Activation Protocol is an open-source infrastructure for creating and scaling **decentralized networks managing real assets**.

It is built on the legal model of a **Series LLC**, which allows a single legal entity (Master DAO) to spawn isolated legal sub-entities (DAO Series), each representing a specific asset.  
This approach enables **protocol-based horizontal scalability of Master DAO nodes** within a decentralized network and **vertical scalability of DAO Series** created under each node.  
All nodes are established under Delaware law, while initiators may be located anywhere in the world, and **assets managed by DAO Series can be physically located in various countries or regions**, while their **ownership is structured within a unified digital governance model defined by the protocol**.

## ❗ Problem

DAOs were originally designed for digital assets and lacked legal standing.  
With the emergence of DAO LLCs — especially in the form of DAO Series LLCs — it became possible to link DAOs to real-world assets. However:

- current implementations remain local and non-standardized;
- there is no reproducible architecture for connecting **legally registered real assets** to blockchain;
- there is no protocol enabling **verifiable scaling of decentralized networks of real assets across jurisdictions**.

---

## 💡 Hypothesis

**A scalable decentralized economy of real assets** is only possible if the following components are present:

- decentralized networks where each asset is governed through a DAO and linked to legally recognized ownership;
- a protocol enabling reproducible formation of such networks;
- a standardized DAO model that can legally own real assets;
- a native network token representing a **discrete unit of real asset value**, currently in use and generating a **verifiable financial flow**.

## 🛠 What is implemented in this MVP (Grant Scope)

### 🔹 Genesis Layer
- Smart contract accepting `DeploymentIntent` from an initiator;
- Name uniqueness check and temporary reservation;
- Agreement file published on IPFS/Arweave;
- Post-registration confirmation by a certified secretary.

### 🔹 Master DAO
- Base template for DAO, linked to Genesis Layer;
- Parameters: name, jurisdiction, contract address;
- Ready to issue DAO Series in future stages.

### 🔹 CLI / Deploy Tool
- Name reservation via Genesis Layer;
- Operating agreement auto-generated from a template;
- IPFS upload and agreement hash generation;
- Submission of `DeploymentIntent`;
- Status tracking via contract.

## ⏳ Not included in MVP

- Token issuance reflecting real asset value;  
- Revenue flow calculation and distribution;  
- DAO Series with asset-bound NFTs;  
- Integration with external DAO frameworks;  
- **Support for a wide range of asset types, including real estate, licenses, corporate shares, patents, and other intellectual property (IP).**

---

## 🧱 Architectural condition

A complete decentralized network of real assets is impossible without a native token,  
which expresses the **value of a discrete unit of a real asset** currently in use and generating a **verifiable income stream**.

Such a token enables:
- on-chain settlement,
- revenue distribution,
- liquidity and scaling.

🔧 This protocol **takes this condition into account at the architectural level**,  
but **does not implement token issuance within this MVP**.
